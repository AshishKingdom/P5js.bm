# p5js.bas
p5.js library written in and adapted for QB64.

## Say what?
Lauren McCarthy has created p5.js, a native JavaScript alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. See more about it at https://p5js.org/

This is a rewrite of all that's possible so that the same paradigms and techniques can be accomplished in QB64. QB64 is a modern extended BASIC programming language that retains QB4.5/Qbasic compatibility and compiles native binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS. See more about it at www.qb64.org and www.qb64.net.

## Is this for the web?

Definitely not. QB64 is a compiled language, so the goal is to make drawing/animation as simple as it is on the web but for Windows/Linux/macOS programs.

## Is this backed by the Processing.js foundation?

We're not related to the Processing.js foundation. We're fans. This is an open source adaptation of existing open source work.
